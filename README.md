# Dialogue of Self-Relationships

This is a real-time performance project combining AR technology with dance. We aspire to explore the possibilities between AR technology and physical performance. Additionally, we aim for this live performance to immerse the audience, allowing them to participate and present the performance together with the dancers.

## concept

In "Meditations on First Philosophy," Descartes explores the nature of self and existence through the argument of "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). He attempts to determine what is real and knowable, addressing the doubts and affirmations regarding self-existence and identity.

Are you really yourself?

Who exactly is controlling you?

Who are you actually controlling?

"Dialogue of Self-Relationships" continually imagines and explores the relationship between the self and the "self." What is the relationship between a person and their various levels, aspects, and environments of self? "Dialogue of Self-Relationships" offers a new "cross-reality" in which participants are given the opportunity to dialogue with "themselves" and explore the "self."

## Performance

The performance offers a new reality in which participants are given the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with "themselves" and explore "the self."
